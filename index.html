Are you curious about the different behaviors and habitats of these creatures throughout the year? We the authors, Tiffany and Gelila, have sought to answer these questions by conducting a study of the wildlife present on campus during both winter and spring this year. By gathering data on the types of animals present, their locations, and behaviors, we aimed to create a comprehensive understanding of the diverse wildlife thriving in our environment. </p>

The two designers exchanged weekly postcards in which they documented and visualized different aspects of their daily lives. Each week, they choose a different theme, collect data, and transform it into hand-drawn visualizations. In [Hyperlink to Dear Data but it is called “Dear Data”], they exchange these weekly visualizations as postcards which consist of creative representations of aspects of their lives. We have mimicked their approach and each created our own hand drawn visualizations of the data. Both of us presenting our unique findings gave us insight into the different perspectives and approaches we each took, leading to a richer understanding of our data!</p>

This includes looking at the animal type and actions of the animal as well. In our data, we numbered each animal we see in order as well as mark what day we saw it, and we also have descriptors for each animal if we don’t know the exact species it belongs to. Here is a snippet of our data: our first eleven entries.</p>

The primary objective behind selecting this graph is to allow the audience to discern the dominant animal species in each season. Upon close observation, several noticeable trends emerge from the chart. For instance, during winter, squirrels, deer, and fish are more prevalent than in spring, while in the latter season, birds, geese, and bunnies have a higher occurrence rate.

We knew we had a lot of data on squirrels and birds, but now we can really see how they really dominate the data, basically dividing it into thirds. During the winter, squirrels took the lead followed closely by the birds. This suggests that squirrels were particularly active during this month, which is as expected, because as the colder seasons come squirrels gather and store food before scarcity. As spring came so did a rise in the bird population, as they migrate back and perhaps start breeding! With this graph, we get a glimpse into wildlife activity influenced by factors like migration patterns and mating seasons.</p>

Clear and expected patterns include the most popular activity for birds as flying and for spring squirrels as running. One good thing about this chart is that you can see how these vary for each season. For instance, during the winter, there is a noticeable reduction in the variety of activity options across all groups. However, during the spring, we observe a significant increase in animal activity options.</p>

We observed some unusual patterns in the weather these past couple of months, with the winter being warmer and the spring being colder with harsh rains. We can also see in the spring there was a concentration of animals in common eating spaces like Sadler as many animals were scavenging around that time.</p>

Are you curious about the different behaviors and habitats of these creatures throughout the year? We the authors, Tiffany and Gelila, have sought to answer these questions by conducting a study of the wildlife present on campus during both winter and spring this year. By gathering data on the types of animals present, their locations, and behaviors, we aimed to create a comprehensive understanding of the diverse wildlife thriving in our environment. </p>

The two designers exchanged weekly postcards in which they documented and visualized different aspects of their daily lives. Each week, they choose a different theme, collect data, and transform it into hand-drawn visualizations. In [Hyperlink to Dear Data but it is called “Dear Data”], they exchange these weekly visualizations as postcards which consist of creative representations of aspects of their lives. We have mimicked their approach and each created our own hand drawn visualizations of the data. Both of us presenting our unique findings gave us insight into the different perspectives and approaches we each took, leading to a richer understanding of our data!</p>
